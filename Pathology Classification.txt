What are the uses of Computer Vision?
Computer vision is a broad term for many projects with the use 
of deep neural networks to develop human-like vision capabilities 
for various applications. Today, computer vision has immense potential 
in real-world applications spanning retail, banking, construction, sports, 
automotive, agriculture, insurance, and beyond. Some use cases involve computer
 vision projects that positively impact the world into a better place.

New Computer Vision Projects 
1. Pathology Classification
The amount of data pathologists need to analyze in 
a day is massive and challenging. Deep learning algorithms
 can identify patterns in large amounts of data. Optical coherence 
tomography (OCT) uses light waves to look inside a living human body. 
It can detect various diseases in humans, plants, and animals. Evaluation 
of issues like thinning skin, broken blood vessels, heart diseases, and many 
other medical problems is possible.
